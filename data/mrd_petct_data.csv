Patient selection: High — only baseline PET-positive patients underwent re-imaging, introducing spectrum restriction and partial verification bias.
Index test (PET/CT): Unclear — working rule CMR = PET_ and PMR/stable/progression = PET_; not a prespecified standardized threshold.
Reference standard (MRD by NGS): Unclear — negativity threshold (10__ vs 10__) not fixed at this timepoint.
Flow & timing: High — paired assessments incomplete (MRD missing in several PET strata) although ±14-day window respected.
Overall: Moderate risk of bias; applicability: Moderate concern.
QUIPS:
Study participation: Moderate–High — subset enriched for PET-positive baseline; limited representativeness.
Study attrition: Moderate — several missing MRD/imaging pairs at re-evaluation; potential informative missingness.
Prognostic-factor measurement (MRD/imaging): Moderate — MRD by NGS robust, but threshold not fixed; PET positivity rule preliminary.
Outcome measurement: Unclear — no survival events, follow-up, or endpoint definitions for this paired cohort.
Confounding: High — no adjusted analyses; ASCT eligibility, maintenance, age, and cytogenetics could confound results.
Statistical analysis & reporting: Low — descriptive reporting only; no major analytic errors.
Overall QUIPS: Moderate risk of bias.",PET/CT repeated only if baseline PET positive,,,Talarico et al 2025,05.10.2025 18:44,05.10.2025 18:44
