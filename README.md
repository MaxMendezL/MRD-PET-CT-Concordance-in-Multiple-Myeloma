# MRD × PET-CT concordance in multiple myeloma
Code and data for the systematic review and meta-analysis of concordance between bone-marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) and PET-CT, and the prognostic
impact of dual-negative MRD–/PET-CT– status.

## Contents
- `MM_Concordance_FullReport.Rmd` – main R Markdown pipeline (runs end-to-end).
- `MM_Concordance_FullReport.html` – rendered report corresponding to the submitted manuscript.
- `R/` – helper functions and figure code.
- `data/` – aggregated study-level datasets (concordance, survival, risk-of-bias, screening log).
- `tables/` – exported tables (e.g. `Supplementary_Tables_MASTER.xlsx`).
- `figs/` – figures generated by the pipeline.
- `doc/` – manuscript and supplementary appendix (Word).

## Reproducing the analysis

   ```r
   install.packages(c(
     "tidyverse", "here", "metafor", "ggplot2", "patchwork",
     "DescTools", "ggrepel", "DiagrammeR", "DiagrammeRsvg", "rsvg", "ragg"
   ))

3. Knit the MM_Concordance_FullReport.Rmd file.
